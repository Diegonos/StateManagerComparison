# StateManagerComparison
In this repo, I'll experiment with 3 different state management libraries: Redux, Zustand, and Recoil.

By analyzing the directories, youâ€™ll notice that only the files inside the store folder, along with Counter.tsx and App.tsx, will change. These are the places where you can see the different approaches used by the libraries.
