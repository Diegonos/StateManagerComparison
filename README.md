# StateManagerComparison
In this repo, I'll experiment with 3 different state management libraries: Redux, Zustand, and Recoil.

By analyzing the directories, youâ€™ll notice that only the files inside the store folder, along with Counter.tsx and App.tsx, will change. These are the places where you can see the different approaches used by the libraries.

Every project will display a counter, a button to increase it and a button to decrease it.

To set up the project execute the following commands:

npm install
npm start

After running the start command, you can view the slides by opening the following URL in your browser:
